        # Interpretable Feature Extraction of Electricity Loads (IFEEL)
        
        * A python package for **Interpretable Feature Extraction of Electricity Loads** (IFEEL).
        * IFEEL has a similar pronunciation to the Eiffel Tower 🗼 so you will find two "Eiffel" electricity towers in the IFEEL logo.
        * Description of IFEEL can be found on **GitHub** [🔗](https://github.com/chacehoo/IFEEL/tree/master/OneDrive%20-%20Nexus365/0_PycharmProjects/MyPackage/IFEEL) (*Recommended, no image loading issue*) or **PyPI** [ 🔗](https://pypi.org/project/ifeel/)

        ## 💬 About IFEEL:
        (1) This Python package (i.e., IFEEL) aims to help energy data analysts to readily extract interpretable features of daily electricity profiles from a physical perspective. The extracted features can be applied for further feature-based machine learning purposes, including feature-based PCA, clustering, classification, and regression.
        
        (2) Two PY files (.py) are included in the IFEEL package, including *ifeel_transformation.py* and *ifeel_extraction.py*.
        
        (3) Two types of features, including 13 global features (GFs) and 8 peak-period features (PFs), can be extracted by using this package. Detailed description of all features can be found in Ref [1] or the Demo file in the installed IFEEL package.
        
        (4) GFs are extracted based on raw time-series data, while PFs are extracted based on symbolic representation of time series data. GFs and PFs can be obtained by using `IFEEL.ifeel_extraction.feature_global` and `IFEEL.ifeel_extraction.feature_peak_period`, respectively. 
        
        (5) For fast peak-period feature extraction, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) representation is first used to transform the time-series numerical patterns into alphabetical words. The feature transformation process is performed by calling `IFEEL.ifeel_transformation.feature_transformation`. More details about SAX approach can be found in Ref [2] and Ref [3].
        
        ## 🔈 Notes:
        (1) To successfully run the IFEEL, the following Python data analysis libraries need to be installed in advance: [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
        
        (2) A **Demo** can be found in the installed IFEEL package or [here](https://github.com/chacehoo/IFEEL/blob/master/OneDrive%20-%20Nexus365/0_PycharmProjects/MyPackage/IFEEL/IFEEL/Demo.py). Three datasets at different time intervals can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/chacehoo/IFEEL/tree/master/OneDrive%20-%20Nexus365/0_PycharmProjects/MyPackage/IFEEL/Test_Data), and tested in the Demo.
        
        (3) The **Demo** has been tested on Python 3.7.7.
